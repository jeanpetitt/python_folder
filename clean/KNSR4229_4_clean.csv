within 90 min of RET",Muscle mass,"A combination of whey and casein
milk proteins can provide the most
perpetual anabolic effects"

Strength (squat and bench press","Soy and whey protein were found
to have similar effects on lean mass
accretion and strength (for both
squat and bench press)"
Lim et al. 2021 [28],≥ 19,"Plant protein vs animal protein
(with or without RET)","Muscle mass
Strength (squat, bench press, grip
strength, peak flexion/extension
of leg)","A nonsignificant favourable effect of
animal protein on absolute lean mass
was seen, and in the subgroup analy‑
sis based on age, an anabolic effect
was only observed in the younger
populations (< 50 years). No statistical
difference between plant and animal
protein was seen for strength out‑
comes aside from a favourable effect
of animal protein on leg extension in
the younger subgroup"
